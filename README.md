# Gold & Silver Market Analysis

An end-to-end analytics project analyzing Gold and Silver prices, volatility behavior,
and evaluating technical indicators using historical data.

## Project Goals
- Analyze long-term Gold and Silver price trends
- Compare volatility and risk characteristics
- Evaluate common technical indicators using backtesting
- Communicate insights through an interactive BI-style dashboard
- Build a portfolio-ready analytics case study

## Tech Stack
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Plotly
- Streamlit

## Key Analysis
- Price trend comparison
- Gold–Silver ratio analysis
- Daily and rolling volatility
- Bollinger Band signal evaluation
- Strategy vs Buy-and-Hold backtesting

## Dashboard
An interactive Streamlit dashboard is included to present insights for non-technical
stakeholders using clean KPIs and interactive charts.

## Backtesting Summary
Bollinger Band signals captured short-term mean-reversion but underperformed a
buy-and-hold approach for long-term trending assets. The analysis highlights the
importance of benchmarking intuitive indicators against simple baselines.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates an evidence-based approach to market analysis, focusing on
validation, risk awareness, and insight communication rather than prediction.
